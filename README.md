=============

Python implementation for extracting a saliency map [1] from a still image.

Requirements:

    Python (>= 2.7 is preferable)
    numpy  (>= 1.7 is preferable)
    OpenCV (>= 2.4 is preferable)
    matplotlib (if you would like to run main.py)

Usage:

    If you would like to test this package, please try
        python main.py
    This provides a simple example how to use the class pySaliencyMap.

    We also provide a sample code for testing this package with your own webcams. Please try
        python main_webcam.py
